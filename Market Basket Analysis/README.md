## Background
Market Basket Analysis is a popular technique used in retail and e-commerce to identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The Apriori Algorithm is a commonly used algorithm for this purpose. It works by generating association rules between items in a dataset based on their frequency of occurrence together in transactions.
## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about customer transactions in a retail store. Each row in the dataset represents a transaction, and the columns represent the items purchased in that transaction.

## Results
The results of the analysis will be printed to the console. The output will include the following:

1) The most commonly purchased items.
2) The support, confidence, and lift values for each association rule.
